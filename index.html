      <h1>Command Line Cheatsheet</h1>
      <p>The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer's operating system to run.</p>
      <p>From the command line you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer. The difference is that the command line is fully text based.</p>
